      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p> I'm working on graduating, keeping my grades above a 3.0 I currently have a 3.6, and I would like to join a sport to be more active and involved in my school.
         I  am working towards these goals by getting help with my school work and I'm am  currently moving to another school and looking to join a sport. I think that 
        the most nessecary values are for me to focus on school and get a tutor I've been in the gym everyday trying to condition my myself for sports. I hope to join a 
        sport  team and become more involved with my school and also graduate.  I would also like to buy my own car specifically a 1988 big  box Chevy candy apple red on
        chrome spinners, this car is expensive but I don't want it handed to me I want to get it on my own.  I want to be known as a person who brightens up a room when
        they walk in. I am aleady a genuinly nice person. So I would like to keep that role as time goes on and not loose who I am. I want to be able to keep it real 
        with people and always stay true to myslef and show my true self.
